            The until method yields the difference between two local dates. For
            example,
            independenceDay.until(christmas)
            yields a period of 5 months and 21 days. That is actually not terribly useful
            because the number of days per month varies. To find the number of days,
            use
            independenceDay.until(christmas, ChronoUnit.DAYS) // 174 days
            Caution
            Some methods in the LocalDate API could potentially create
            nonexistent dates. For example, adding one month to January 31 should
            not yield February 31. Instead of throwing an exception, these methods
            return the last valid day of the month. For example,
            LocalDate.of(2016, 1, 31).plusMonths(1)
            and
            LocalDate.of(2016, 3, 31).minusMonths(1)
            yield February 29, 2016.
            The getDayOfWeek yields the weekday, as a value of the DayOfWeek
            enumeration. DayOfWeek.MONDAY has the numerical value 1, and
            DayOfWeek.SUNDAY has the value 7. For example,
            LocalDate.of(1900, 1, 1).getDayOfWeek().getValue()
            yields 1. The DayOfWeek enumeration has convenience methods plus
            and minus to compute weekdays modulo 7. For example,
            DayOfWeek.SATURDAY.plus(3) yields DayOfWeek.TUESDAY.
            Note
            The weekend days actually come at the end of the week. This is different
            from java.util.Calendar where Sunday has value 1 and Saturday
            value 7.
            Java 9 adds two useful methods datesUntil that yield streams of
            LocalDate objects.
            LocalDate start = LocalDate.of(2000, 1, 1);
            LocalDate endExclusive = LocalDate.now();
            StreamLocalDate allDays = start.datesUntil(endExclusive);
            StreamLocalDate firstDaysInMonth =
                start.datesUntil(endExclusive, Period.ofMonths(1));
                In addition to LocalDate, there are also classes MonthDay,
                YearMonth, and Year to describe partial dates. For example, December
                25 (with the year unspecified) can be represented as a MonthDay.
                The example program in Listing 6.2 shows how to work with the
                LocalDate class.
